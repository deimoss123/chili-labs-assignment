# Products list assignment

This project is a test assignment for the Front End developer position at Chili Labs.
<br/>
The website also is hosted on Vercel [here](https://chili-labs-assignment.vercel.app/).
<br/>
Note that some images have black borders around them, this is the fault of the free API I used.
